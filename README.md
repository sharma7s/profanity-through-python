# profanity-through-python

Assumptions:

The tweets file is a text file where each line contains a single tweet.

The racial slurs file is a text file where each line contains a single racial slur.

A racial slur is any word in the tweet that is an exact match to a word in the racial slurs set.

The degree of profanity for each tweet is calculated as the ratio of the number of racial slurs in the tweet to the total number of words in the tweet.
